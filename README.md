# TAS
This script is used to format our TAS into a PDF.

It converts a Google Sheet into a Google Slide with the necessary formatting and images, then exports it as a PDF. The generated PDF is uploaded to a designated folder in Google Drive called "PDF TAS." A PDF Transit file is also required for the script to function correctly.

TAS links can then be used for mail merge to send documents to families.

Known Issues

Long text does not automatically shrink to fit within the allocated space, which may result in text overflow. Any overflow must be manually adjusted before uploading the final version to the PDF TAS folder (the same link can be used after edits).

Development Information

This script is written in JavaScript.
It was developed with external assistance in July 2019.
